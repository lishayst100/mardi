        <h2>How it all began...</h2>
        <p class="para">
            The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in
            what is now
            lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as
            part of an
            observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is
            unknown. A 1730
            account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including
            cross-dressing).
            Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already
            established.
            Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by
            law, and
            were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.

            In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money to
            fund an
            official Mardi Gras celebration.

            James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New Orleans Mardi
            Gras in
            1835:[2]

            Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun, frolic,
            and comic
            masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys,
            women and
            girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in grotesque,
            quizzical,
            diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds,
            beasts and birds
            with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the
            moon;
            mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts,
            coaches, cars,
            &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling,
            fifeing, and
            all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.

           
            Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays dues,
            and any member
            can have a place on a parade float.

            <h3>LaToya Cantrell</h3>
            <p class="para-mayor">Mayor of New Orleans</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para">Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position in the
            city's history. Once
            in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic plan to
            address
            families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with finding
            solutions to
            violent crime.[29] Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for city use,
            Cantrell has
            focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks,
            and green
            spaces.[30] As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four
            opioid
            manufacturers and distributors.[31]

            During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with
            Governor John
            Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront funding for
            the city's
            infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city.[32] Following the
            approval of the
            Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Cantrell and the City Council put on
            the ballot
            in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental
            properties, as
            well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.</p>
